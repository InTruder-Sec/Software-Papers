Wireless Connectivity 

01 | Title:Advanced Antennas Push Forward Wireless Connectivity
Author: Kwai Man Luk, Baoyan Duan
Category: Wireless Technology
Discription:Antennas are critical components for wireless connectivity. In general, antennas with a wide bandwidth, compact size, and high efficiency are required in order to achieve a high level of system performance with modern wireless communication systems, sensor networks, radio astronomy, deep space probes, and so on.

01 | Title:IHA Cryptography Algorithm
Author: Deep Dhakate
Category: Cyber Security;Discription: IH is a unique hashing algorithm which works on base 10 digits for hashing. This hashing algorithm works on each of these digits to convert them into an unpredictable number format. The overall size of the hash is 38, 6 greater than the size of MD5 Hashing algorithm. The algorithm is designed such that operations made on the digits is almost impossible to reverse, and its really hard even for a machine to reverse it using all the possible digits. Each of letters, numbers, symbol, and even different number of spaces have different number of spaces.
